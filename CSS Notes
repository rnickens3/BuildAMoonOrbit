- The place-items property can be used to set the align-items and justify-items values at the same time. The place-items property takes one or two values. If one value is provided, it is used for both the align-items and justify-items properties. If two values are provided, the first value is used for the align-items property and the second value is used for the justify-items property.

- You can normalize all CSS rules by targeting "*" like this:
*, ::before, ::after {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

- A good way to work with "rem" units is setting the font size of HTML early on to "font-size: 62.5%". This way, 1rem is 10px, 2rem is 20px, etc.

- Use "object-fit: cover" to crop an image when the window is resized to retain aspect ratio

- With CSS grid, it will always create rows automatically. To fix the icons from adjusting themselves vertically, use "grid-template-columns: repeat(# of items, 1fr)" to space all items in the grid evenly and horizontally in a single row 
.social-icons {
  display: grid;
  font-size: 3rem;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);
}

- You can create columns within an element without using Grid by using the "column-width" property. This can be done with large paragraphs of text to split it up so it is more readable. You can also give the text a "text-align: justify" property.

- Utilize media queries! They are great for sizing content on screens. 
@media only screen and (max-width: 720px) {
  .image-wrapper {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
